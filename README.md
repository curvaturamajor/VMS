Visitor Management System


> create new db and import "cvmsdb.sql"

login info: \n
id:"admin" pas:"asdasd"
id:"admin2" pas:"asdasd"
id"sysadmin" pas"asdasd" 
(sysadmin is system admin and has full control over other administrators, meaning sysadmin can add new administrators, edit existing administrator information, or delete administrator account.)

All names, phone numbers and ID numbers in the database are fake. These data have been fabricated to test the system.
